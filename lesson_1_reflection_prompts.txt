How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you
see the bug that was introduced?Viewing a diff between the two versions of a
file made it very easy to compare lines that had changed.  It was much easier
than going through files line by line and trying to find the
lines that had changed and then finding the error.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Having easy access to the entire history will save a lot of time!

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
Docs does?
I love having the control over when you commit.  You want it to be purposeful.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git caters to programming and Google Docs does not.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
You use them in the terminal  Don't forget to use commit id's when using git
 diff.

 How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
 could break something?
 It is easy to go back to an earlier version and it really helps with
 trouble shooting!

 Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
